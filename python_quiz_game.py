# Python quiz game
# Declare all the Collections and variables we will need:
# We need a Tuple of questions,a 2D tuple of options
# I will have five questions, but you need to have 12
# It will also have a tuple of answers.
# There will be list of guesses so we can append our list.

# There will be these variables:
# score set to 0
# question_num to keep track of what number question we are on

# Begin with questions

             "Which animal lays the largest eggs?: ",
             "What is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere?: ",
             "How many bones are in the human body?: ",
             "Which planet in the solar system is the hottest?: ")

# Now we display each question
# We can iterate over a Tuple of questions as they are iterable
for question in questions:
    print("----------------------")  # Decorative Text
    print(question)         # after we display every question we need to
    # display every option

    for option in options[question_num]:    # options is a 2D Tuple
        # add index operator - question_num variable
        # its a number so at first we are
        # accessing options at index of zero
        # then one, two, three, four, five
        print(option)  # print every option in options at given row number

# as we test the above we have some options but all of these options are for the first question
# we will need to increment our question number

    question_num += 1  # this now gives us the correct options for each question
